            <h2>Finals almost done!</h2>
            <h5>December 17th, 2022</h5>
            
            <p>Hi! I've had yet another busy week at school. All but one of my finals are finished! I have a Linear Algebra final on Tuesday (<b class="computerCode" id="finals_over_countdown"></b>), and after that I am done for the semester (woohoo!). Then starts my winter break, which lasts until January 18th. It'll be a very well-deserved break.</p>
            <p><em>What to do with all that free time?</em> First and foremost, I'll be spending lots of time with my family, friends, and girlfriend. After a rough semester, we all deserve some time to relax and have some fun. I'll also be using some of that time to work on some coding projects that I've been doing. You can check out some of them on my <a href="https://www.github.com/jharrisong830">GitHub</a>. I've also been doing Advent of Code throughout the month. I'm getting through all of the days (rather slowly), and my goal is to finish all of the days at some point in the near future.</p>
            <p>And now, for a cool picture! This one I took on a Monday morning, when I arrived back at school early in the morning. The view from my dorm is stunning, and I feel so lucky to have such a great living situation this year.</p>
            <p>If I don't get around to posting during the remainder of the month (I probably won't), then Happy Holidays and have a happy new year!</p>

            <h2>Long time no see!</h2>
            <h5>December 10th, 2022</h5>
            
            <p>It's been a while! School has been very busy so I haven't had much time to dedicate to the blog. (I still don't have much time; there's lots of work to do between finishing up assignments and studying for finals!) Once winter break starts, I should be able to put more focus on my personal projects.</p>
            <p>Speaking of personal projects, there are two that have been posted to my GitHub! The first (as promised) is my computer architecture project, <a href="https://www.github.com/jharrisong830/cpuwu">CPuwu</a>! I've also been working on implementing <a href="https://www.github.com/jharrisong830/linalg">linear algebra functions in python</a>, so be sure to check both of these projects out if your're interested!</p>
            <p>No pictures today because the projects should be enough content for a while. See you in a month probably!</p>

            <h2>CPU/Assembler upgrades.</h2>
            <h5>November 20th, 2022</h5>
            
            <p>Hello! o/</p>
            <p>I've had this bad habit where I will stay up <em>realllyyy</em> late at night working on homework. In fact, on Friday I stayed up until 1:30am working on my CPU project. I restarted the project from scratch and made a new circuit, with a more organized and readable structure. Unfortunately, I can't share much in terms of screenshots as the project isn't due yet. After it's done, I might upload it to my <a href="https://www.github.com/jharrisong830">GitHub</a><img src="images/picture_per_day/11-20-22.jpg" class="fright" width="auto" height="280px"> page (including the Logisim circuit file, assembler, and language instructions). Be sure to check that out often to see all of my personal projects!</p>
            <p>Since, I can't share pictures of my project, I will instead post a picture of something a received in the mail last week: <b>my Irish passport!</b> My dad and his family were born and raised in Ireland, and they moved to the United States when he was 13. Ireland's citizenship laws are very cool; children of Irish-born citizens are also automatically Irish citizens, and therefore eligible to apply for a passport. So, that's what I did! Not that I'm doing any traveling any time soon, but it's always nice to have the benefits that come with being a dual citizen.</p>
            <p>Okay, now back to CS stuff! Originally I designed the langauge around a 16-bit machine code, but quickly realized that if I wanted to add more functionality to the CPU, I would need to increase the machine code to 32 bits. Now, the language supports loading and storing from memory, as well as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing 8-bit numbers. More instructions will be added soon, as well as an upgrade to a pipelined datapath.</p>
            <p>I also did some more research on Python functions that I can use to make a more capable assembler. I wish I could, but I can't share details of my assembler implementation until after I submit the project (in case anyone I know from school ends up reading this). The project is due December 5th (<b class="computerCode">finished</b>). <del><em>See me flexing my JavaScript skills? Be impressed!</em></del></p>
            <p>I have an exam early tomorrow morning, so I better get to bed. Good night!</p>

            <h2>Building a CPU and an assembler.</h2>

            <p>For today's picture: what the dog doin.</p>
            <p>This is my dog, Maya! I miss her a lot when I'm at school. She misses me a lot too, and always gets really excited when I come home for the weekend. I'm going home on a Sunday this week so I'll see her soon!</p>
            <img src="images/picture_per_day/11-17-22_code.png" class="fright" width="350px" height="auto">
            <p>I've gotten a head start on a project for my Computer Architecture class: building a CPU, creating an assembly language, and an assembler to process instructions. Before you ask, no, its not a <em>real</em> CPU; it's a virtual one. Our task was to build a "CPU" in Logisim (a program for building and simulating circuits and logic gates), create our own assembly language and machine code, and also an assembler program to translate from assembly to machine code.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, I had a <b>lot</b> of fun with this project. Most of my friends and classmates would dread having to do schoolwork in their free time, and I thought I would feel the same. However this semester I've been enjoying the content of my classes a lot more. Right now I am taking Computer Architecture and Algorithms. Aside from a couple of topics, I've been able to easily absorb and apply the content of these classes. All of the programming assignments are really fun for me, and I think I've really developed a passion for coding! <del>Even though I'm just typing words like an essay right now, I'm having fun because there is a bunch of code on my screen!</del> Recently, I've been doing a few small side-projects in Python. One program was a test script for an extra credit assignment, which would run C++ code and test to see if the output was correct. Another program, which I am currently working on, is an assembler script, to translate my assembly language into a machine code image file to be used in Logisim (see image for example). I'm going to start doing more projects in Python soon, especially over winter break once I have more time.</p>
            <p>That's all for today's post, I'll be sure to post more updates soon about the CPU project and my other personal projects!</p>

            <p>It's been a while! I had a lot of exam prep the past few weeks and also got stuck on what to include in these posts. But don't worry, I'll be more consistent with content on this site soon!</p>
            <p>I've been taking a lot of pictures lately. I feel very lucky to live in New Jersey during the fall months; it provides me with lots of opportunities to take some really cool pictures (as you can see on the right side of this post). In the spirit of sharing my pictures and strengthening my formatting skills, I want to include a new picture with every post that I make, starting today!</p>
            <p>Ever since I got my first iPhone, I made an effort to take cool pictures when I could in order to make full use of the camera. I don't think I've ever considered making it a hobby until recently. <em>Maybe that could justify investing in some equipment that's better than an iPhone?</em> My recent shots have been of my dog, the fall foliage, and my college campus, all of which will appear in future posts!</p>
            <p>Anyways, enjoy the picture!</p>

            <h2>My first blog!</h2>
            <h5>November 5th, 2022</h5>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! I've never really written a blog before or posted on the internet ever, so this is all very new to me. (I think the most blogging I've done is serially-posting on Twitter when I first got an account back in middle school. It was a very cringe account!) But anyways, this will be my first "post" on my first blog.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of this page is to, first and foremost, practice HTML and CSS programming. The best way to learn is by doing, so I am doing! I feel rather behind on my skills compared to some of my classmates, and I want to expand those skills and work my way up towards more complex projects. This blog will be my first <em>true</em> personal programming project that I've worked on. (As such, please don't expect any fancing formatting or features in these early days; I'm still learning. <strong>But, do check back often, as I will update formatting and features as I learn more!</strong></p>
            <p><em>What to include in my first blog...?</em> I guess an introduction would be nice! My name is John (o/ hi!). I'm currently a sophomore (almost junior) Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology (in Hoboken, NJ). I was born and raised in a small suburb in northern New Jersey. Computers have always been a hobby for me; while my friends would ask for new shoes and such for birthdays, I would ask for new tech and gadgets to entertain myself with. My first true experience with computer science was during my freshman year of high school, and I've loved it ever since! Unfortunately, my school's computer science offerings were extremely lacking (perhaps that's a topic for another blog post!), but ever since starting at Stevens in 2021, I've been slowly and surely expanding my skillset.</p>
            <p>I might be late to the game when it comes to learning HTML and CSS, but better late than never! I'm not sure yet how frequently I will post or what kinds of things I will write about. Keep reading to find out!</p>
