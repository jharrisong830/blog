            <h2>My first blog!</h2>
            <h5>November 5th, 2022</h5>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! I've never really written a blog before or posted on the internet ever, so this is all very new 
                to me. (I think the most blogging I've done is serially-posting on Twitter when I first got an account back in 
                middle school. It was a very cringe account!) But anyways, this will be my first "post" on my first blog.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of this page is to, first and foremost, practice HTML and CSS programming. The best way to learn is 
                by doing, so I am doing! I feel rather behind on my skills compared to some of my classmates, and I want to expand 
                those skills and work my way up towards more complex projects. This blog will be my first <em>true</em> personal 
                programming project that I've worked on. (As such, please don't expect any fancing formatting or features in these 
                early days; I'm still learning. <strong>But, do check back often, as I will update formatting and features as I 
                learn more!</strong></p>
            <p><em>What to include in my first blog...?</em> I guess an introduction would be nice! My name is John (o/ hi!). 
                I'm currently a sophomore (almost junior) Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology 
                (in Hoboken, NJ). I was born and raised in a small suburb in northern New Jersey. Computers have always been a 
                hobby for me; while my friends would ask for new shoes and such for birthdays, I would ask for new tech and gadgets 
                to entertain myself with. My first true experience with computer science was during my freshman year of high school, 
                and I've loved it ever since! Unfortunately, my school's computer science offerings were extremely lacking 
                (perhaps that's a topic for another blog post!), but ever since starting at Stevens in 2021, I've been slowly and 
                surely expanding my skillset.</p>
            <p>I might be late to the game when it comes to learning HTML and CSS, but better late than never! I'm not sure yet 
                how frequently I will post or what kinds of things I will write about. Keep reading to find out!</p>
