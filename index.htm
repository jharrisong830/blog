            <p>For today's picture: what the dog doin.</p>
            <p>This is my dog, Maya! I miss her a lot when I'm at school. She misses me a lot too, and always gets really excited when I come home for the weekend. I'm going home on a Sunday this week so I'll see her soon!</p>
            <img src="images/picture_per_day/11-17-22_code.png" class="fright" width="350px" height="auto">
            <p>I've gotten a head start on a project for my Computer Architecture class: building a CPU, creating an assembly language, and an assembler to process instructions. Before you ask, no, its not a <em>real</em> CPU; it's a virtual one. Our task was to build a "CPU" in Logisim (a program for building and simulating circuits and logic gates), create our own assembly language and machine code, and also an assembler program to translate from assembly to machine code.</p>
            <p>Surprisingly, I had a <b>lot</b> of fun with this project. Most of my friends and classmates would dread having to do schoolwork in their free time, and I thought I would feel the same. However this semester I've been enjoying the content of my classes a lot more. Right now I am taking Computer Architecture and Algorithms. Aside from a couple of topics, I've been able to easily absorb and apply the content of these classes. All of the programming assignments are really fun for me, and I think I've really developed a passion for coding! <del>Even though I'm just typing words like an essay right now, I'm having fun because there is a bunch of code on my screen!</del> Recently, I've been doing a few small side-projects in Python. One program was a test script for an extra credit assignment, which would run C++ code and test to see if the output was correct. Another program, which I am currently working on, is an assembler script, to translate my assembly language into a machine code image file to be used in Logisim (see image for example). I'm going to start doing more projects in Python soon, especially over winter break once I have more time.</p>
            <p>That's all for today's post, I'll be sure to post more updates soon about the CPU project and my other personal projects!</p>

            <p>It's been a while! I had a lot of exam prep the past few weeks and also got stuck on what to include in these posts. But don't worry, I'll be more consistent with content on this site soon!</p>
            <p>I've been taking a lot of pictures lately. I feel very lucky to live in New Jersey during the fall months; it provides me with lots of opportunities to take some really cool pictures (as you can see on the right side of this post). In the spirit of sharing my pictures and strengthening my formatting skills, I want to include a new picture with every post that I make, starting today!</p>
            <p>Ever since I got my first iPhone, I made an effort to take cool pictures when I could in order to make full use of the camera. I don't think I've ever considered making it a hobby until recently. <em>Maybe that could justify investing in some equipment that's better than an iPhone?</em> My recent shots have been of my dog, the fall foliage, and my college campus, all of which will appear in future posts!</p>
            <p>Anyways, enjoy the picture!</p>

            <h2>My first blog!</h2>
            <h5>November 5th, 2022</h5>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! I've never really written a blog before or posted on the internet ever, so this is all very new to me. (I think the most blogging I've done is serially-posting on Twitter when I first got an account back in middle school. It was a very cringe account!) But anyways, this will be my first "post" on my first blog.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of this page is to, first and foremost, practice HTML and CSS programming. The best way to learn is by doing, so I am doing! I feel rather behind on my skills compared to some of my classmates, and I want to expand those skills and work my way up towards more complex projects. This blog will be my first <em>true</em> personal programming project that I've worked on. (As such, please don't expect any fancing formatting or features in these early days; I'm still learning. <strong>But, do check back often, as I will update formatting and features as I learn more!</strong></p>
            <p><em>What to include in my first blog...?</em> I guess an introduction would be nice! My name is John (o/ hi!). I'm currently a sophomore (almost junior) Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology (in Hoboken, NJ). I was born and raised in a small suburb in northern New Jersey. Computers have always been a hobby for me; while my friends would ask for new shoes and such for birthdays, I would ask for new tech and gadgets to entertain myself with. My first true experience with computer science was during my freshman year of high school, and I've loved it ever since! Unfortunately, my school's computer science offerings were extremely lacking (perhaps that's a topic for another blog post!), but ever since starting at Stevens in 2021, I've been slowly and surely expanding my skillset.</p>
            <p>I might be late to the game when it comes to learning HTML and CSS, but better late than never! I'm not sure yet how frequently I will post or what kinds of things I will write about. Keep reading to find out!</p>
