            <p>It's been a while! I had a lot of exam prep the past few weeks and also got stuck on what to include in these posts. But don't worry, I'll be more consistent with content on this site soon!</p>
            <p>I've been taking a lot of pictures lately. I feel very lucky to live in New Jersey during the fall months; it provides me with lots of opportunities to take some really cool pictures (as you can see on the right side of this post). In the spirit of sharing my pictures and strengthening my formatting skills, I want to include a new picture with every post that I make, starting today!</p>
            <p>Ever since I got my first iPhone, I made an effort to take cool pictures when I could in order to make full use of the camera. I don't think I've ever considered making it a hobby until recently. <em>Maybe that could justify investing in some equipment that's better than an iPhone?</em> My recent shots have been of my dog, the fall foliage, and my college campus, all of which will appear in future posts!</p>
            <p>Anyways, enjoy the picture!</p>

            <h2>My first blog!</h2>
            <h5>November 5th, 2022</h5>
            <p>Welcome to my blog! I've never really written a blog before or posted on the internet ever, so this is all very new to me. (I think the most blogging I've done is serially-posting on Twitter when I first got an account back in middle school. It was a very cringe account!) But anyways, this will be my first "post" on my first blog.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of this page is to, first and foremost, practice HTML and CSS programming. The best way to learn is by doing, so I am doing! I feel rather behind on my skills compared to some of my classmates, and I want to expand those skills and work my way up towards more complex projects. This blog will be my first <em>true</em> personal programming project that I've worked on. (As such, please don't expect any fancing formatting or features in these early days; I'm still learning. <strong>But, do check back often, as I will update formatting and features as I learn more!</strong></p>
            <p><em>What to include in my first blog...?</em> I guess an introduction would be nice! My name is John (o/ hi!). I'm currently a sophomore (almost junior) Computer Science student at Stevens Institute of Technology (in Hoboken, NJ). I was born and raised in a small suburb in northern New Jersey. Computers have always been a hobby for me; while my friends would ask for new shoes and such for birthdays, I would ask for new tech and gadgets to entertain myself with. My first true experience with computer science was during my freshman year of high school, and I've loved it ever since! Unfortunately, my school's computer science offerings were extremely lacking (perhaps that's a topic for another blog post!), but ever since starting at Stevens in 2021, I've been slowly and surely expanding my skillset.</p>
            <p>I might be late to the game when it comes to learning HTML and CSS, but better late than never! I'm not sure yet how frequently I will post or what kinds of things I will write about. Keep reading to find out!</p>
